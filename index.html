          <p>
            “When I came to CU as a freshman I felt lost and empty. Even though
            I grew up going to church I was only a Christian by name and felt
            disconnected from God. After hearing a message at church about
            making a decision to repent and give your life to Jesus, I knew that
            was the right thing to do. I understood that day that I had been
            trading the truth of Jesus for other things that left me empty and
            dead. So, I decided to make a trade: my life for the eternal life
            found in Christ!”

          <h4>Fulfillment In Christ</h4>
          <p>
            “I did not come to CU with any intention of pursuing God, but only
            to have a good time and do what Boulder had to offer me. The
            lifestyle I began to live left me feeling very unfulfilled and far
            from God. I began to cry out to God for His help, and shortly after
            I was met by a campus minister with Resurrection Church. He shared
            with me what I had heard before growing up but never fully
            understood; that Jesus gave His life for me and the only proper
            response was for me to give my life to Him in surrender. It was
            September of my sophomore year that I made the decision to give my
            life to Jesus, and I found true fulfillment in Him.”

          <h4>Forgiveness Is Real</h4>
          <p>
            “I came to college with a desire to live the full college life. I
            was convinced that joining a fraternity, making friends, and
            constantly seeking pleasure would bring me fulfillment, but all that
            indulgence left me feeling empty and alone on the inside. The guilt
            of my sin was so real that I often had sleepless nights, thinking
            about eternity. When I decided to surrender my life to Jesus, the
            peace of God filled me up, and I knew that His forgiveness was real.
            Following after His will for my life has convinced me that there is
            no greater way for a person to live!”<br />

            party and drug culture here and felt very alone. My second semester
            my freshman year, I began doing a Bible study with a campus minister
            from Resurrection Church who met me on campus and shared the Gospel
            with me. One night, I had an encounter with Jesus in my dorm room
            that changed my life. I made the decision to repent and give my life
            to Him, and now I’m so thankful to be saved and know I’m never
            alone!”

          <h4>Trading Shame for Joy</h4>
          <p>
            “I was raised in a Christian household, but I always followed my own
            sinful desires and plans rather than the Lord’s. I came to CU to
            pursue my dream of becoming a doctor and to experience the party
            scene. Deep down I was ashamed of the decisions I was making and I
            knew I needed to change. After meeting a minister with Resurrection
            Church I began to pray and read the Bible. I began to sense how much
            God loves me and I knew that an eternity away from Him was not worth
            the temporary satisfaction of sin. I decided to turn to the Lord and
            follow Him, and He took my shame and filled me with joy!”

          <h4>Called by Christ</h4>
          <p>
            “Growing up I heard Jesus was good and that He loved me, but I had
            bad things happen in my life that caused me to question His
            existence. I felt an emptiness in my life and I started chasing
            after sinful things and even other doctrines and religions thinking
            it would fill me, but it never did. I started having reoccurring
            dreams about Jesus and friends and even strangers started talking to
            me about Him. I knew this was Him calling out to me to have a
            relationship with Him. My sophomore year at CU I decided to answer
            that call and give my life to Jesus. He has filled my heart beyond
            measure and my life has never been the same because of His great
            love for me!”

          <h4>Found Hope in Jesus</h4>
          <p>
            “I came to college believing God was real and calling myself a
            Christian, but I was truly independent and untrusting of Him. Going
            to church my first semester, I met some people my age that shared
            with me how Jesus changed their lives. After seeing their love for
            Jesus and hearing how He saved them, it gave me hope to believe that
            I could decide to trust and follow Him too. As the Lord softened my
            heart to the truth of Jesus’ love for me and his sacrifice for my
            sin, I soon made a decision to follow and trust Him with my whole
            life. Since then, He has radically changed my heart and given me
            true hope instead of the emptiness and frustration I felt before
            knowing Him.”

          <h4>Being Set Free</h4>
          <p>
            “I came to CU full of shame and guilt from things I had done in my
            past. I knew I had to change, but I had no idea how to change the
            direction of my life. I was met by a minister with Resurrection
            Church one day on campus who shared the gospel with me; it was
            exactly what I needed to hear! I gave my life to Christ shortly
            thereafter, and Jesus has radically changed my life and set me
            free!”

          <h4>Identity Found in the Lord</h4>
          <p>
            “Growing up I tried to find my identity by trying to fit into my
            image of perfection. My self-worth came from how well I performed in
            certain aspects of my life – whether it was school or work or in my
            social life. By the time I started college at CU, I was depressed,
            anxious, and had developed an eating disorder. I felt like a failure
            because I wasn’t measuring up to my standards of perfection. All of
            that changed after I gave my life to Jesus. He set me free from the
            depression and the eating disorder, and I know now that my identity
            is found in Him. He removed the false burdens that I placed on
            myself and has shown me that it’s because of his perfect goodness
            that I’m saved from sin. He has filled me with a joy that I didn’t
            know was possible!”

          <h4>The Holy Spirit Works in You</h4>
          <p>
            “In high school I tried to balance being a good student with a drug
            and alcohol lifestyle that I tried to hide from my parents. I went
            to CU Boulder to completely join to the party lifestyle, and joined
            a fraternity. From my religious background and the Holy Spirit
            working in my life, I started to realize I was not right with God. I
            did not know how to pursue Him but in my empty state I knew changes
            had to be made. I met a campus minister with Resurrection Church my
            sophomore year who helped me realize my need to repent. I gave my
            life fully to Jesus Christ, and through discipleship I have become a
            confident man of God with a family and career.”

          <h4>Healed From Celiac Disease</h4>
          <p>
            “I was diagnosed with celiac disease when I was fourteen years old,
            and it was torturous. When I started on a gluten-free diet I would
            find myself doubled over with severe stomach pain after eating even
            small amounts of gluten. As a student at CU, I began attending
            Resurrection Church and one day I asked for prayer to be healed of
            my disease. At lunch that same day breadsticks were served and,
            believing that God is who He says He is as the Lord who Heals, I
            decided to try one of the breadsticks, and ended up eating three
            with no reaction whatsoever! Follow up medical tests confirmed that
            I was completely healed.”

          <h4>Made New in Christ</h4>
          <p>
            “When I got to college, the party lifestyle was more real to me than
            God was. I quickly got involved in heavy drug use, and began
            exploring other spiritual teachings like Eastern Philosophy and even
            witchcraft. A friend from high school invited me to church when I
            was in a dark place as a 21 year-old. The weight of my sin was
            already very real to me, but it was at a church service that the
            Holy Spirit caused the message of the cross of Jesus and His love
            for me to become very real. I decided to repent and follow Jesus
            that day, and He set me free from addiction, depression, self-hate,
            and much more and He made me brand new.”

          <h4>Jesus Is God</h4>
          <p>
            “I was born and raised in the Vail Valley in Colorado and, while I
            would often go to church, God was largely an afterthought as I spent
            most of my time and energy on skiing and pursuing fun. CU-Boulder
            was the only school that I applied to and I went into the College of
            Engineering with the intention of continuing to party and ski while
            also obtaining a good education. The consequences of my sin steadily
            began to catch up with me as academic probation, run-ins with the
            police, and a general sense of anxiety began to weigh me down.
            During my junior year I began doing Bible studies with a minister
            with Resurrection Church and, as I began to read through the Gospel
            of Luke, I had a revelation that Jesus is God! This ultimately led
            to my surrender to the King of Kings later that year and my life has
            never been the same.”

          <h4>Never Too Far Gone</h4>
          <p>
            “When I came to CU Boulder I believed in God, but I did not have a
            personal relationship with Jesus. Within the first few weeks of the
            semester, I found myself in deep darkness in my mind and heart and I
            felt that I was “too far gone” to ever be a Christian. Despite my
            unbelief, the Holy Spirit began to convict me of my sin, and I
            started to cry out for help and answers. Not long after that, I met
            a campus minister and she shared with me about how Jesus died for my
            sins and that I could be forgiven and be made right with God through
            faith in Christ. When I repented and surrendered my life to Jesus, I
            immediately felt shame lift off my life and I knew I was changed
            forever!”
