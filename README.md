# Church-Website

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practice HTML, CSS and Java Script by recreating the Resurrection Chruch homepage as closely as I can. I created only the homepage, but the links are active and will direct to the corresponding page on the real church website. 

## Visit Website
